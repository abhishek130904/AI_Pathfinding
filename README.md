**Path Hunter** is an interactive Pygame application where you challenge the famous **A\*** pathfinding algorithm.  
Navigate a player through a randomly generated maze, reach the goal, and then watch as A* reveals the most optimal path.  

⚡ Can you find the shortest route faster than the computer?

## 📜 Description
Path Hunter is both a **fun challenge** and a **visualizer** for the A\* pathfinding algorithm.  
You set start and end points on a grid filled with random obstacles, then guide your character to the goal.  

When you succeed, A* kicks in — showing its search step by step (open/closed nodes) before revealing the **optimal path**.  

The game then scores you based on:  
- **Efficiency** (your path length vs. optimal path length)  
- **Speed** (time taken to finish)
